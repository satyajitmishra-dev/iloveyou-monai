# Sounds Instructions

Add the following optional audio files to this folder for enhanced interactivity:

1. **click.mp3** - Soft click sound for button interactions (~0.1-0.2s)
2. **success.mp3** - Cheerful success/positive sound for the final action (~0.5-1s)
3. **confetti.mp3** - Celebratory sound effect (~0.3-0.5s)
4. **heartbeat.mp3** - Romantic heartbeat sound (~0.5-1s)
5. **whoosh.mp3** - Whoosh/transition sound (~0.2-0.3s)

These are optional. If not provided, the app will continue to work without sound effects. The use-sound library will gracefully handle missing files.
